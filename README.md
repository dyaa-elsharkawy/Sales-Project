I’ve just completed an in-depth Sales Data Analysis for a company in the fitness and dietary supplements industry. This project allowed me to explore key business insights and sales KPIs, including revenue, profit, and much more.

Here’s what I accomplished:

Data Extraction: Pulled sales data directly from SQL Server.

Data Cleaning: Utilized Power Query for comprehensive data cleaning and transformations, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

Data Modeling: Implemented a Star Schema for optimized performance, streamlining relationships between fact and dimension tables for better analysis.

DAX Calculations: Developed custom DAX measures to calculate crucial KPIs like revenue, profit, and other performance metrics, enabling a deeper dive into trends and overall business performance.

Key Analysis Areas:

Customer Segmentation: Analyzing purchasing behavior to understand customer trends and preferences.

Product Analysis: Identifying top-performing products and pinpointing areas for improvement.

Location Insights: Exploring sales patterns across different regions.

Time Analysis: Tracking sales performance over time to detect seasonality and forecast future trends.

Returns Analysis: Investigating product returns to refine strategies and minimize future losses.


This project also provides a detailed overview of the insights uncovered through data visualization, helping to drive better decision-making.
